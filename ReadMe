# CampusConnect

A campus collaboration platform for students to request help, share resources, and communicate with peers.

---

## What is CampusConnect?

**CampusConnect** helps university students connect and collaborate by providing three core features:

1. **Request System** - Post help requests (study partners, tutoring, materials) with urgency levels and get responses from peers
2. **Resource Sharing** - Upload and download study materials (PDFs, notes, assignments) with likes and downloads tracking  
3. **Real-time Chat** - Direct and group messaging with emoji support

Built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with JWT authentication and responsive design.

## How It Works

**For Students Needing Help:**
- Create a request specifying what you need (tutoring, study partner, materials)
- Set urgency level (low/medium/high) and category
- Receive responses from fellow students with messages or file attachments
- Start a direct chat with helpers

**For Students Offering Help:**
- Browse the dashboard to see pending requests from peers
- Filter by category, urgency, or search keywords
- Respond with text or upload files
- Track your contribution stats

**Resource Sharing:**
- Upload study materials, notes, or assignments
- Organize with categories and tags
- Download resources shared by others
- Like and bookmark helpful content

**Communication:**
- Create direct (1-on-1) or group chats
- Search for users by email to start conversations
- Messages update automatically (polling every second)
- Add emojis to messages

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui components  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, JWT authentication, Multer (file uploads)  
**Database:** MongoDB Atlas with Mongoose ODM  
**Key Features:** Bcrypt password hashing, email-based password reset, responsive design

---

## Database Design

**Users** - Store student profiles (name, email, university, major) with hashed passwords  
**Posts** - Track uploaded resources with author, file URL, likes, views, downloads  
**Requests** - Help requests with category, urgency, status, and responses array  
**Chats** - Conversations with participants, messages (embedded), and chat type (direct/group)

**Relationships:** Posts/Requests/Chats reference User IDs; participant names are denormalized for performance
